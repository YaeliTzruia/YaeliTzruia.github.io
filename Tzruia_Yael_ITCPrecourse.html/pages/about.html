        <h3>My Geography</h3>
        <p>I have lived and visited many places but four specific places had a bigger part of my life more than any other. </p>

        <p>
        Even though my parents lived on the outside of NykÃ¶ping I was born in Ã–rebro, in one of the biggest and most specialised hospitals in the country. The reason to this is because my mom had Lupus and neither she nor I and my siblings were expected to survive beyond 20 weeks. Agents the odds I was born and brought up on the country side of NykÃ¶ping in a small area called Gammelsta, surrounded by forest. 
        </P>
        <p>
        The house we lived in used to be an old school and the foundation of this old building belonged to an old church that's today lying in ruins on a hill in view of my parents house.

          <p> When I turned 19 I decided to move to Israel to convert to Judaism, a process that took me 3 years to complete. During this time I studied at Machon Ora in Jerusalem, a place that made everything I have today possible.

    <h3>Why Coding?</h3>

    <img style="text-align: right; float: right; transform: none;" class="me" src="../images/meanderan.jpg" alt="Me and my husband" width="300" height="300"> 
<p>I have searched for what I would want to do as a profession since I was a teenager. When I was 19, right after high school and 1 year of working my focus became converting to Judaism in Israel. After finishing my three-year-prosses to become a jewish girl I moved back to Sweden. During this time in my life I tried many different professions; waitressing, gym instructor, sales, personal assistant, managing position in the fast-food business, supermarket, hotel staff, in hope to find the answer to the question Iâ€™d asked myself since teenage years. I didnâ€™t find it in Sweden, nor in my first years in Israel. A close friend of mine suggested that Iâ€™d look into coding, saying that she believed it to be a good fit for me. I started after that to learn a bit on my own and I really enjoy it! I enjoy the problem solving and analytic aspect of coding, as well as the creative part. Itâ€™s really exiting to see what I could do with only a few words.
</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a mom so the majority of my free time goes to my children. I love being with them, and seeing how they lit up when weâ€™re doing fun activities outside. I also love to read (right now Iâ€™m reading Jim Kwikâ€™s book Limitless and really recommend it!), sing, write stories, play the piano, swim in the ocean, travel abroad, visiting my family in Sweden and date nights with my beloved husband.</p>
